# Feed Reader Testing
The file feedreader.js is a test suite for this project which contains multiple specs. These specs are supposed to pass in order to have bug-free feed reader application.

##How to run the test
Just open the index.html file in the browser. The result of the test cases would be shown at the bottom of the page.

##Requirements of the assignment
1. Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
2. Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
3. Write a new test suite named "The menu".
4. Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default. You'll have to analyze the HTML and the CSS to determine how we're performing the hiding/showing of the menu element.
5. Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display when clicked and does it hide when clicked again.
6. Write a test suite named "Initial Entries".
7. Write a test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.
8. Write a test suite named "New Feed Selection".
9. Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.
